## Description

The site is a side project for current CodeUp Java Cohorts who are looking for additional practice and hands-on while providing additional visibility to contributing developers and their skills and expertise.  The Developers will be demonstrating their use of GitHub branching, as well as, HTML, CSS, JavaScrit along with Bootstrap and jQuery.
 
This readme document is in progress and will be expanded on as the project progresses.
